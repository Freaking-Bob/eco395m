Hi, my name is Linyao Ni.
I'm a master's student in economics at UT Austin.
I'm interested in econometrics, programming (Pyton, Stata, R), and data science applications.
Recently I'm also focusing on the latest development of artificial intelligence and its application is different industries.
Looking forward to collaborating with classmates!
